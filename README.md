# Kaggle Dataset ETL, EDA, and Predictive Modeling

> This project demonstrates a comprehensive data science workflow, from ETL on Kaggle datasets to predictive modeling using multiple linear regression.


## About

This project showcases the following key steps in a typical data science project:

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Batch loading of multiple CSV datasets from Kaggle, data cleaning, and transformation using Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  In-depth analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- **Preprocessing:** Encoding of predictor variables and normalization for optimal model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating a multiple linear regression model.
